        The first part was created by Lorenzo Diana
        , who proceeded to create the relational scheme
         for the Functional Requirements. Later he created
         the web application from which it was possible to
         create and scroll through a catalog relating to the
         Functional Requirements.
        The second part of the project was created by Roberto
         Chello, who created the relationship scheme, and
          the related database, for the Assurance Requirements.
        The web application created by Lorenzo Diana has been
         modified to allow navigation of the catalog of Assurance Requirements.
