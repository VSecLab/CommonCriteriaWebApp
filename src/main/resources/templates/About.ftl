        This thesis work has been developed at the
        University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, in association
        with Prof. Massimiliano Rak.


</br>
        This work focused on the design and implementation of a
        web application for the management of a database relating
        to the international standard ISO/IEC1 5408.
        </br>
        The first part was created by Lorenzo Diana,
        who proceeded to create the relational scheme
        for the Functional Requirements. Later he created
        the web application from which it was possible to
        create and scroll through a catalog relating to the
        Functional Requirements.
        </br>
        The second part of the project was created by Roberto
        Chello, who created the relationship scheme, and
        the related database, for the Assurance Requirements.
        The web application created by Lorenzo Diana has been
        modified to allow navigation of the catalog of Assurance Requirements.
